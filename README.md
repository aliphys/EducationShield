CTC 101 Project
===========

CTC 101 is a modular STEAM program consisting of a toolbox with more than 25 projects and easy to assemble experiments, an online platform, and guided educators support.
The library is an educational project carried by Arduino LLC in Malmo. It is a collection of exercises commissioned by the Center of Resources for Education at Castilla La Mancha to be tried out in the classrooms during the Spring 2013. If you want to collaborate by adding translations to this collection of exercises, just send us a note to d.cuartielles AT arduino.cc.
